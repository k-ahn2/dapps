///
/// Reads pull bytes from an internal pipe fed by the dispatcher via
/// <see cref="PushIncoming"/>; writes serialise bytes into a 'D' frame
/// and hand them to the supplied write callback so the dispatcher's
/// shared <see cref="AgwFrameTransport"/> stays the only place frames
/// hit the wire. <see cref="SignalRemoteDisconnect"/> closes the pipe
/// from the writer side; subsequent reads return 0 (EOF).
///
/// Contrast <see cref="AgwSessionStream"/>, which assumes one session
/// per AGW socket and pulls frames directly. That's correct for the
/// outbound code path; this class is for the inbound code path where
/// many sessions multiplex.
